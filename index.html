1. OPEN TERMINAL  
 
cd Desktop 
mkdir basic-app 
cd basic-app 
code . 
 
2. VS CODE WILL BE OPENED AUTOMATICALLY, THEN OPEN NEW TERMINAL IN VS 
CODE  
 
npm init 
(add description if want , then yes) 
 
3. package.json FILE WILL BE CREATED AUTOMATICALLY THEN , CREATE AN EMPTY 
FILE WITH NAME index.js 
 
4. AGAIN OPEN TERMINAL 
 
npm i express 
(node_modules) will be created  
 
5. WRITE IN index.js FILE 
 
const express = require(“express”); 
const app = express(); 
 
app.get(“/”,(req,res)=>{ 
res.json([ 
      { 
         id:1, 
         name:”abhinav”, 
         age:20 
       }, 
      { 
         id:2, 
         name:”abhishek”, 
         age:22 
       }, 
      { 
         id:3, 
         name:”abhijeet”, 
         age:24 
       }, 
      { 
         id:4, 
         name:”abhiraj”, 
         age:26 
       }, 
]) 
}); 
app.listen(5500,()=>{ 
         console.log(“app is running on 5500 port”) 
}) 
 
6. RUN THE FILE IN TERMINAL USING  
 
node index.js 
 
7. OPEN CHROME AND SEARCH FOR  
 
localhost:5500 
  
 
➢ CREATING DOCKER FILE AND MAKING IT’S IMAGE 
 
1. CREATE NEW FILE WITH THE NAME & INSTALL DOCKER EXTENSION IN VS CODE 
 
dockerfile      
 
2. OR ELSE IN TERMINAL WRITE  
 
touch dockerfile 
 
3. WRITE IN dockerfile 
 
FROM node:latest 
COPY . . 
RUN npm install  
EXPOSE 5500 
CMD [“node”,”index.js”] 
 
4. OPEN TERMINAL  
docker build -t basic-app . 
5. THE IMAGE WILL BE BUILT IN DOCKER DESKTOP , IF YOU WANT TO CHECK THE 
IMAGES BUILT , OPEN TERMINAL  
docker images 
➢ RUNNING THE IMAGES WITH THE HELP OF CONTAINERS 
1. 
WE CAN RUN THE IMAGE DIRECTLY UNDER IMAGE TAB IN DOCKER DESKTOP , BY 
ASSIGNING THE CONTAINER NAME & ASSIGNING THE PORT AS 5500  
2. ALSO BY ASSIGNING PORT VALUE AS 0 , IT WILL GENERATE RANDOM PORT NO 
3. ANOTHER WAY IS USING TERMINAL 
docker run –name basic-app-container -p 5500:5500 basic-app  
➢ DELETION OF IMAGES & CONTAINERS 
1. OPEN TERMINAL  
FOR UNUSED : docker image rm basic-app 
FOR IN-USE : docker image rm basic-app -f 
2. TO DELETE IN-USE IMAGES THERE IS ANOTHER WAY I.E., BY DELETING THE 
CONTAINER 
docker ps -a 
docker container rm basic-app 
3. TO DELETE ALL CONTAINERS AT ONCE 
docker system prune -a
